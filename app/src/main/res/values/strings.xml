    <string name="howToPlay"><b>How to play Auburn Match</b>\n\nAuburn Match is an Auburn twist on the
        classic game Memory. The basic game is played with cards all face down on the board. There
        are two of each card on the board, and the goal is to match each card with its partner.
        Choose two cards at a time, if they match they will be removed from play. If not, they will
        be turned back over.\n\n<b>Classic Mode:</b> Match all of the cards in the fewest moves possible.\n\n
        <b>Timed Mode:</b> Match all of the cards in the quickest time.\n\n<b>Versus Mode:</b> This is a local
        two player game mode. Take turns with a friend playing the game, and whoever has the most
        matches when all the cards are matched wins!\n\nSo get going and match all things Auburn from
        Aubie to Bo to Jordan-Hare and more!
